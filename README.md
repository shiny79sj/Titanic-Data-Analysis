# Titanic Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover insights related to passenger survival. The dataset includes information about passengers' demographics, fare, and survival status, and the analysis aims to understand patterns and factors affecting survival rates.

## Project Description

This analysis explores the Titanic dataset to:
- Determine survival rates by passenger demographics and class.
- Explore correlations between features and survival chances.
- Create visualizations to better understand the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Titanic passenger data from Kaggle. It includes the following columns:
- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1, 2, 3).
- `Name`: Passenger's name.
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard.
- `Ticket`: Ticket number.
- `Fare`: Fare paid by the passenger.
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).
- `Survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
